# analytics

**analytics** is a set of microservices (*Lambda*, *ECS*) designed to collect data on electricity prices in Poland and selected European countries, as well as on the operation of the Polish power system.

The collected data is used to generate reports for interested entities, and in the future, some of it will be presented in graphical form.
